            How to Write a Story: A Complete Step-By-Step Guide to Writing a Good
            Story
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <h3>
          <strong>Step 1: Determine Your Setting</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Location is an enormously useful tool in novel-building. You should treat it
          as you would treat a character, allowing it to convey mood and letting it
          reveal more of itself over time. By selecting locations that excite you, you
          can transform relatively mundane scenes into more compelling ones. Your
          enthusiasm will come through in your writing, and your characters will view
          and interact with your locales in a more engaged way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location can also provide the inspiration for scenes and can even shape the
          course of your story. All the research you conducted in the first phase of
          writing will come in handy during your first draft, when you find yourself
          needing to describe a particular street, park, or other scene set somewhere
          previously unfamiliar to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To weave setting into your story, ask yourself the following questions, then
          answer them in your prose.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What season is your novel set in? What is the weather like in your
            location at that time?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the elements of your setting like during this time? For example,
            was that business closed fifteen years ago? Did that street have a
            different name then? Was that statue erected before your characters
            arrived there?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does your novel center around a major world event, like war or natural
            disaster? How does this limit or define your time frame and impact your
            setting?
          </li>
          <li>
            What cultural details belong to this time and location? Consider music,
            literature, entertainment, clothing styles, food trends, lifestyle trends,
            and big national events or crises that shape public sentiments.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Step 2: Make Memorable Characters</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Character and event are inseparable, because a person is what happens to
          them. You might think of this as a distinction from films, where actors are
          cast into pre-existing roles. But a novel is a character interacting with
          events over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your job as a writer is to learn about your character by observing how they
          interact with the world around them. Characters—like real people—have
          hobbies, pets, histories, ruminations, and obsessions. It's essential to
          your novel that you understand these aspects of your character so that you
          are equipped to understand how they may react under the pressures of events
          they encounter.

        <h3>
          <strong>Step 3: Understand the 2 Types of Conflict</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every story is made up of both events and characters. A story happens
          because a pattern is interrupted. If you are writing about a day that is
          like any other day, it is most likely a routine, not a story. In order to be
          a story, something has to happen. We call what happens in a novel the plot.
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of conflict:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Internal conflict (a threat from within)</li>
          <li>2. External conflict (a threat from outside)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Both types of conflict create tension in a narrative and help move the story
          forward. Conflict drives character development as well as plot. Conflict
          also adds layers to your story. Your main character can face an external
          conflict like destroying a sworn enemy while also battling a more subtle,
          internal conflict: her vow towards pacifism. Your plot will develop
          naturally if you give your character a motivation, then throw obstacles in
          her way.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be a good idea to test out both types of conflict before you settle
          on one. Why not write a short story that uses both types of conflict, and
          then decide which one works best for you?
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what combination of events you knit together to make the plot,
          each should be compelling and significant enough to pull your reader into
          the story and make them wonder what will happen next.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Step 4: Give Your Plot a Twist</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Any good story will include a few plot twists and red herrings. Read on to
          find out more.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Include at least two or three twists in your story. These help keep
            readers engaged, especially in the middle of your book when your plot
            might otherwise start to drag. Carrying readers through the middle of a
            story is challenging, and there needs to be enough excitement to keep them
            reading to the end. A great twist will surprise the reader and turn their
            whole understanding of the story on its head.{" "}

            Trick your readers by planting \"false leads.\" Also known as \"red
            herrings,\" these are details added to purposefully mislead people and
            prevent them from predicting an outcome. While adult mysteries are filled
            with carefully hidden clues, children's horror novels should be packed
            with tricks to lead kids astray and thereby surprise them even more when
            something (like the true identity of a monster) is revealed. Read more

            A \"cliffhanger\" is a device that compels readers to find out what
            happens next in a story. Writing great cliffhangers is key to making your
            book a page-turner and it's one of the easiest ways to make your writing
            more suspenseful. Some writers might feel it to be a \"cheap trick\" or an
            easy gimmick, but it's a tried and true way to get people to read—and keep
            them reading.{" "}

          <strong>Step 5: Recreate Natural Dialogue</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In real life, speech has lots of padding or \"stuffing\": words like{" "}
          <i>umms</i> and <i>yeahs</i>. But dialogue in fiction must be both more
          incisive and selective. It is shorn down to reveal what people want from one
          another, reveal character, and dramatize power struggles.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When your characters are speaking, they should be trying to get something
            from one another, or make a power play. (Seduction is one form of power
            play.) As you draft each scene, ask yourself what your characters are
            trying to get. What are they trying to avoid? How do these wants inflect
            their speech and guide what they say—or don't say?
          </li>
          <li>
            There are often wide gaps between what people say and what they are
            thinking, between what one understands and what one refuses to hear. These
            gaps can collectively be referred to as <i>subtext</i>, and they are
            valuable territory for the fiction writer. Stay alert to a character's
            thoughts, and let them generate drama in the scenes you write.
          </li>
          <li>
            To get dialogue right, you must understand how your characters speak. This
            is likely influenced by where they come from, their social class,
            upbringing, and myriad other factors. Speech and tone are always bound up
            in what has happened and is happening to a character.
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are setting your story in the past, your dialogue should accurately
            reflect idioms and speech patterns of the period. Words, like clothes, go
            in and out of style. Conversations need to be specific to the time you're
            writing in without seeming contrived.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Step 6: Articulate Voice Through Point of View</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          One way to determine what point of view strategy to use in your novel is to
          ask: whose voice is telling the story? To whom are they telling it, and why?
          Common point of view strategies include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>First person point of view</strong>. This is the \"I.\"
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='\"https://masterclass.com/articles/tips-for-writing-third-person-limited-point-of-view\"'>
              <strong>Third person limited</strong>
            </a>
            <strong> point of view</strong>. This is the \"he\" or \"she.\"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third person omniscient point of view</strong>, in which a
            narrator who is not a character and who knows more than the characters
            relays the events to the reader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second person point of view</strong>, which is structured around
            the \"you\" pronoun, and is less common in novel-length work but can work
            well for short stories.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don't have to be tied to one point of view throughout your short story
          or your novel; some bestselling novels move from first to third or first to
          second. Let your material guide your decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only way to decide the best point of view strategy for your novel is to
          try different ones. Likely, you'll know the right one for your story because
          the writing will begin to move more quickly, and you'll feel momentum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Point of view strategy is deeply bound up with what story you want to tell
          and will guide how that story unspools. So no matter where you are in the
          drafting process, devote some time to thinking through the risks and rewards
          of different POV strategies and consider who in your story may be best
          suited to hold the narrative reins.{" "}

        <p>
          There's no right or wrong way to write a story. Good fiction writing takes a
          lot of imagination, time, and practice on your part as a writer. Even the
          best writers practice writing different stories, just like athletes are
          constantly training at the gym. The first time can be hard, but it gets
          easier with practice. Work steadily, and if getting published is your goal,
          stay focused and keep developing your skills. You'll get there!
